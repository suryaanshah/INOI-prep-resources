# Benefits of INOI
 
# Basics of CS
1. CS50. Watch till lecture 5 (Data Structures). [Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
*Note: Do all the assignments till lecture 5*

2. Learn C++
Since C++ is the only language accepted in the INOI and the IOI, it is useful to start with this even if this is your first time programming.

Also, since CS50 teaches C language, it is now much easier to learn C++ with this [small 4 hour tutorial](

# Small Advice
Since we can give both ZIO and ZCO and qualify either of them for appearing in INOI,
I suggest giving both of them for practice and increasing the chance of qualification.
