# Basics of CS
1. CS50. Watch till lecture 5 (Data Structures). [Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
*Note: Do all the assignments till lecture 5*

2. Learn C++
Since C++ is the only language accepted in the INOI and the IOI, it is useful to start with this even if this is your first time programming.

Also, since CS50 teaches C language, it is now much easier to learn C++ with this [small 4 hour tutorial](

>## *Small Advice*
>Since we can give both ZIO and ZCO and qualify either of them for appearing in INOI,
>I suggest giving both of them for practice and increasing the chance of qualification.


# Touch typing
This should come first although this isn't a strict requirement. Learning to touch-type (type without needing to see the keyboard) is a useful skill in CS. You can type much faster this way. This isn't a strict requirement though but I recommend learning it if you have time. 

### Resources for learning touch-typing
> *Remember touch typing only comes with practice*

1. [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) (for simple UI and practice)
2. [Typingclub](https://typingclub.com/) (a step-by-step touch-typing learning course with practice)

# Maths
- Set theory and Mathematical Reasoning ([freeCodeCamp-lecture](https://youtube.com/watch?v=2SpuBqvNjHI))
- [ORAC](https://orac.amt.edu.au/learn/)

# Practice

- Try Hackerrank C++ problems (1-2 problems each day) [link](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)
- Must do archive of ZCO/ZIO and INOI [link](
- Australian learn-to-code site has some amazing tutorials [ORAC](https://orac.amt.edu.au/hub/)
- USACO Training Site [link](https://usaco.training/)

## Mock tests
> Mock tests give you a great practice and opportunity for managing load on THE DAY! 

> *I suggest giving as many, ideally give previous year papers of not just your country but every top countries' olympiad*

Some of the top ones include:
- Hong Kong Informatics Olympiad problems [link](https://hkoi.org/en/past-problems/)
- Russian Olympiad Problems [link](https://inf-open.ru/archive/)
- USA Olympiad Problems [link](https://www.usaco.training)
- Romanian Olympiad Problems [link](https://rmi.lbi.ro/rmi_2023/contest/previous/)

> NOTE: You may use Translation software for any language that you do not understand. 

# C++ Resources
Let's say while solving the problems you need some refference of the syntaxt. [Cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) will help you.
